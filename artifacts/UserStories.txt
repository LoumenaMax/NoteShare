Jessie is a 19-year-old college student currently in his second year. Jessie is currently
enrolled in a GE course, which he doesn’t enjoy. Jessie doesn’t know anybody in the course
and is seated next to rather unsociable people. One day Jessie misses a class for
unavoidable reasons and is now in need of the notes from the lecture he missed. Jessie
can’t talk to his seatmates or ask a friend for their notes. The teacher doesn’t post his
lectures online either. Jessie needs a place where he can obtain the notes for a course
which is specific to his school and teacher.


Tom is a 21-year-old graduate student. Tom is a great student who never misses a day of
attendance. Tom also takes great notes during lectures. Tom keeps all his notebooks from
his previous classes, but he doesn’t know what to do with them. He no longer needs the
notes from those courses, so they are of no use to him. However, he spent a significant
amount of time and effort creating those notes and he doesn’t want to see that effort
thrown away. Tom needs a place where he can put those notes so that they can still be of
use to somebody.
